# Documentation Background Color

Study goal is to identify the best background color for documentation pages.

Our will is to provide an adequate reading & learning experience to developers reading Hackt documentation.


## Recommendation

Use blue backgound and light text (light blue/white).

## Discussion

Blue background is preferred by most people (under subjective analysis).

It also leads to better character identification, text comprehension, and information retention (under objective analysis). Although considerably strong across multiple studies, is not an absolute consensus.

Light color (light blue, white) is ideal for text in blue background, since it leads to higher contrast ratio.


## Findings

Notes from "_Effects of ambient illumination conditions and background color on visual performance with TFT-LCD screens_" [^study-1]:

* Background color is the most significant factor affecting visual performance [^visual-performance], among the ones studied
* "_Blue background resulted in best character identification performance_" and also "_(...) better text comprehension performance_"
* Reasons for good performance of blue background:
    - Reduced color saturation
    - Lower luminance
    - Increased brightness and saturation under lower luminance
    - Higher ΔE [^study-4] (considered good predictor of legibility performance)
* "_Chromatic background with primary colors [^primary-colors] had better visual performance than monochromatic or middle-point [^middle-point-colors] colored backgrounds_"
* Variations in ambient illumination color and intensity does not affect the visual performance under blue background


Notes from "_The impact of web page text-background colour combinations on readability, retention, aesthetics and behavioural intention_" [^study-2]:

* Greater color contrast ratio provides better readability
* Blue background wins in all dimensions: readability, information retention, aesthetics, behavior


Notes from "_Color-difference prediction of legibility performance for CRT raster imagery_" [^study-3]:

* "_Preferences were highest in the region of green to blue_"
* Color preference is "_positively related to brightness and saturation_"
* For Blue, a mid-level brightness and saturation is preferred by men and women


Notes from "_Legibility and Subjective Preference for Color Combinations in Text_" [^study-5]:

* "_Cool background colors (blue and bluish cyan) tended to be preferred for the light-on-dark polarity_"


Notes from "_The Measurement of Meaning_" [^study-6]:

* "_Blue proved to be the most favorable color_" on the _evaluative factor_ (the color is associated with 'good')
* Evaluative factor plays a dominant role in human judgement (50% - 75%)
* Activity factor: blue ranks towards the passive end [^activity-passive-end]


Notes from "_Effects of vdt leadingdisplay design on visual performance of users in handling static and dynamic display information dual-tasks_" [^study-7]:

* On tasks involving scrolling, positive backgrounds (black on white) lead to better performance in comparison to negative backgrounds (white on black)
* This is a disadvantage for backgrounds with darker colors


Notes from "_Effects of screen type, ambient illumination, and color combination on VDT visual performance and subjective preference_" [^study-8]:

* Combiantions of blue text and yellow background rank highest on visual performance [^visual-performance]
* Despite differing with other studies, this one tried the blue background only with yellow, red and purple texts, not white, for example. For this reason, we don't consider invalid the good performance of blue background found in other studies.

## Footnotes

[^visual-performance] Visual performance comprises both *character identification* performance and *text comprehension* performance.

[^primary-colors] Red, blue, green.

[^middle-point-colors] Cyan, yellow, purple.

[^activity-passive-end] Although not discussed in the literature reviewed, intuitively we tend to think that a passive behavior level is more suitable for study & reading activities.
